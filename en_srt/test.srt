1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,450
All right let's now deal with when someone

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,450
reaches to the far side of your body

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,550
whether it's to your far side leg or

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,890
far side of your head and as

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,650
you see as we talked about earlier so

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,470
when the arm's here I can attach

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,530
it when he takes it to

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,130
the far side so either to

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,470
my head here okay or looking

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,710
for like grips here or going to

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,890
these these grips like this trying

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,270
to scoop it with my left arm

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,790
like I've been doing it's going

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,590
to be really busy.

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,830
And it's just not going to work.

16
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,010
Okay.

17
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,470
So I can still get it I will

18
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,790
end up scooping with my left arm.

19
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,530
But I just have to do it.

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,330
A slightly different way.

21
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,610
Okay.

22
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,150
So we'll go from the hands on the

23
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,370
shins first so that's pretty common

24
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,430
way people will toriando as they

25
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,070
or work towards north-south.

26
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,390
Okay.

27
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,670
So what I do here keep my knees tight.

28
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,610
Actually sorry.

29
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,650
And I should say we're going

30
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,850
to go through the reverse joy

31
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,950
bar which deals with this

32
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,890
in a slightly different way.

33
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,690
But for now we're just

34
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,250
going to try and pass

35
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,170
it back to the regular joy bar okay.

36
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,590
So from here if I can as he goes around

37
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,930
I'm going to fold up grab the tricep

38
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,510
grab the wrist pass the arm above my head

39
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,910
and take my head out the other side.

40
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,190
Okay.

41
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,090
And you'll see as I do that

42
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,070
I'm starting to fold

43
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,750
it into my into my

44
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,710
elbow if possible right ideally

45
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,330
here it's possible you end up

46
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,790
like even just next to your

47
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,890
head which is not as good

48
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,790
as I talked about before.

49
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,890
But ideally we get it folded around

50
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,590
that you know we're bending their elbow

51
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,430
and folding it around our own elbow

52
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,850
getting some of that shoulder pressure.

53
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,170
Right okay once we're there we're in

54
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,570
our regular finishing position.

55
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:35,930
Okay.

56
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,970
So again Jayden goes

57
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,390
from north-south start.

58
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,170
So he's going normal he changes his hand.

59
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,690
Right I go elbow wrist.

60
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,390
I take my head to the

61
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,310
other side so you have to like

62
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,850
duck your head under as you grab

63
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,690
your grip so we're here.

64
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,690
And we can look for the finish

65
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,650
if he changes to the far side of

66
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,030
my head it's similar so he grabs

67
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,970
the far side of my head.

68
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,310
It's just probably a little

69
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,410
bit more jammed up.

70
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:02,710
Okay.

71
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,930
But I grab the wrist I grab it I

72
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,610
want to have my knees ready to frame.

73
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,950
So if he tries to close the

74
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,290
gap in to pass that's difficult okay

75
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,090
as I take my head to

76
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,510
the other side right this one.

77
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,590
I'll probably just get it stuck on

78
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,470
the head but that's okay.

79
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,810
I'm trying to keep some

80
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,230
some frame and some distance

81
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,150
usually on this one because we're in north

82
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,890
south you can chop straight to the armpit

83
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,610
you don't need like there's no

84
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,590
point chopping the head

85
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,010
here you might do the

86
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,050
knee down for a moment if you need to.

87
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,770
But if we've got access to chop

88
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,830
straight to the armpit okay.

89
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,130
And we look for the finish.
